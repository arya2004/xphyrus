## Overview

**Xphyrus** is a cloud-native platform designed to facilitate coding assessments in an educational environment. It enables teachers to create classrooms, set up coding tests with multiple coding questions, and evaluate students' coding skills efficiently. Students can start tests, solve coding problems, and receive instant feedback on their solutions based on predefined test cases.

## Features

- **Classroom Management**: Teachers can create and manage multiple classrooms for different courses or groups of students.
- **Test Creation**: Teachers can create tests within classrooms, each containing multiple coding questions.
- **Coding Questions**: Each coding question can be set up with multiple test cases to evaluate the student's code.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Students receive immediate results for their code submissions based on the provided test cases.
- **Cloud-Native**: All coding and testing are done in the cloud, ensuring a consistent environment for all users.
